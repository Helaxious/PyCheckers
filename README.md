# PyCheckers!
A classic board game implemented in `pygame`! Complete with every feature you need to play checkers! It also features saving/loading (though single-player mode isn't available yet)

## Features

### Gameplay

The normal gameplay you expect from checkers, move that, capture this, crown that. (except that it doesn't have forced captures)

### Save n' load

I don't know why someone would ever want save states in checkers, but I implemented it anyway, it's the basic gist, save, load, or delete your save

### Win

Of course, there's no game if there's no way to win, win by capturing all enemy pieces.

Or if you want, you can trap your enemy, leaving him with no other moves to make, granting you a win!
